ZORO AI
Zoro AI is a web application that allows users to input JavaScript code and get an AI-powered code review. The app provides a code editor with syntax highlighting, a clean interface, and the ability to toggle between dark and light themes.

Features
Code Editor: A code editor powered by react-simple-code-editor with syntax highlighting using prismjs.
AI-powered Code Review: Submit your code and receive a code review generated by an AI model.
Theme Toggle: Switch between dark and light themes.
Clipboard Copy: Copy the entire response or just the code snippet to your clipboard.
Technologies Used
Frontend:

React
react-simple-code-editor
prismjs for syntax highlighting
react-markdown for rendering Markdown content
axios for making HTTP requests
lucide-react for icons
CSS for styling
Backend:

Node.js
Express.js (assumed for backend API)
External API integration for AI-powered code reviews (e.g., Google Generative AI)
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or higher)
npm or yarn
Frontend Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zoro-ai.git
cd zoro-ai
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Run the frontend development server:

bash
Copy
npm start
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application in action.

Backend Setup
Navigate to your backend folder (or assume it's in the same repository, if not adjust according to your file structure).

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
cd backend
npm install
Make sure the backend server is running on port 5000 (or change the URL accordingly in your frontend code):

bash
Copy
npm start
Your backend should now be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

API Integration
The backend is responsible for integrating with an external AI API for generating code reviews. You can modify the backend to use any external service that suits your needs.

Usage
Open the app in your browser.
Type or paste your JavaScript code into the editor.
Click "Submit" to send your code to the backend and get a code review response.
Use the "Copy Code" button to copy only the code snippet or the "Copy" button to copy the entire response.
Themes
Zoro AI supports both light and dark themes. You can toggle between them by clicking the theme toggle button in the navbar.
